## [2.4.0-pre.5] - 2024-02-13

### Changed

* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.12

### Changed

* Updated Burst dependency to 1.8.10
* Add lightweight spinlock to secure multithread write access to the `ChildSafetyHandles` in custom allocator framework.


## [2.4.0-exp.2] - 2023-11-09

### Added

* `DataStreamReader.ReadBytes` and `DataStreamWriter.WriteBytes` now have a variant that takes a `Span<byte>` as a parameter, making it easier to use these APIs with regular `byte[]` arrays.

### Changed

* The minimum supported editor version is now 2022.3.11f1


## [2.3.0-pre.3] - 2023-10-17

### Changed

* Updated version for release preparation.


## [2.3.0-exp.1] - 2023-09-18

### Added

* Added a new `GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr` method to `DataStreamReader`. This can be used as an escape hatch if access to the underlying buffer of the stream reader is required.

### Fixed

* A previous release did not allow `unsafeList.RemoveRange(unsafeList.Length, 0)` anymore, which could cause failures in many common algorithms. This has been fixed.
* Made `SortJob.SegmentSort`, and `SortJob.SegmentSortMerge` public to allow generic job type registration.
* `UnsafeList.RemoveAtSwapBack` could read invalid memory when the last element of the list is removed
* Data elements in FixedList<T, U> now respect natural alignment for the type T


## [2.2.1] - 2023-09-11

### Changed

* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.8

### Fixed

* Previously the `Sort` extension for NativeContainers could access memory out of bounds of the container when an invalid `IComparer<T>` was implemented for `T`: Comparers must return three states (<0, 0, >0). Sort will now no longer access invalid memory and when running with collection checks enabled (e.g. always on in Editor) or using `UNITY_DOTS_DEBUG` in player builds, an additional check at the beginning of the sort will validate the comparer is implemented correctly and inform users otherwise.

### Added

* Added a dependency on the com.unity.test-framework.performance package


## [2.2.0] - 2023-06-20


### Changed
* Made `SegmentSort` and `SegmentSortMerge` public to allow generic job type registration.


### Fixed

* Previously it was possible to change the length of a `NativeList` via the `Length` property setter while the NativeList is being used inside of a job without an InvalidOperationExcpetion being thrown for the unsafe access.


## [2.1.4] - 2023-04-25

### Removed

* Dependency on com.unity.test-framework.performance
* Dependency on com.unity.test-framework


## [2.1.1] - 2023-04-12

### Added

* `IJobParallelBatch` provides `.Schedule`, `.ScheduleByRef`, `.ScheduleParallel`, `.ScheduleParallelByRef`, `.Run` and .`RunByRef` forms. `.ScheduleParallel` is equivalent to calling `.ScheduleBatch`.
* Added `Trim`, `TrimStart`, `TrimEnd`, `ToLowerAscii`, `ToUpperAscii` methods to strings.
* `NativeQueue.ReadOnly`.
* `UnsafeParallelHashMap.ReadOnly`.
* UnsafeQueue container type
* `Unsafe/NativeParallelMultiHashMap.ReadOnly` view into container.
* `UnsafeList.ReadOnly` enumerator.

### Changed

* Added additional `UNITY_DOTS_DEBUG` checks to collection types to help with standalone player debugging (since `ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTION_CHECKS` safety checks are unavailable in standalone player builds)
* Updated Burst version to 1.8.4
* Reduced the amount of memory allocated by allocating based on the maximum number of worker threads the running platform requires rather than defaulting to using a theoretical upper-bound of 128 worker threads.

### Fixed

* Calling `Dispose` on uninitialized container will not throw.
* Properly tracks allocations made from the collections package such that when `Unity.Collections.NativeLeakDetectionMode` is `NativeLeakDetectionMode.Enabled` or `NativeLeakDetectionMode.EnabledWithStackTrace`, native memory leaks will be reported upon domain reload.
* UnsafeParallelHashSet.ReadOnly was not usable in jobs due to extraneous [NativeContainer] attribute
* NativeRingQueue.Dispose(JobHandle) allowed scheduling as a race condition
* Dispose(JobHandle) for many native containers adhere to proper safety system expectations
* Lowered benchmark memory usage in non-desktop player builds to avoid out-of-memory failures
* Fixed container types could provide unaligned access to `T` elements which could violate platform alignment requirements resulting in native exceptions / crashes in player builds. All fixed types like `FixedList<T>` now provide 8 byte alignment for the `FixedList<T>` type itself, whereas the elements `T` remain naturally aligned in the contiguous storage buffer inside `FixedList<T>`



## [2.1.0-pre.18] - 2023-03-21

### Added

* UnsafeParallelHashMap.ParallelWriter.ThreadIndex is a public read-only property to mirror functionality in NativeParallelHashMap

* UnsafeParallelHashMap.ParallelWriter.TryAdd that takes a thread index argument for advanced usage
* `Starts/EndsWith` to `Native/UnsafeText` and `FixedStringN`.

### Changed

* `NativeReference/NativeList.GetUnsafePtr` returns typed pointer `T*` instead of typeless `void*`.
* Updated Burst version in use to 1.8.3
* Updated auto-generated allocator performance comparison documentation
* NativeParallelHashMap.ParallelWriter.m_ThreadIndex public property renamed to ThreadIndex
* Allocator benchmark documentation updated to reflect corrected performance measurements
* NativeParallelHashMap.ParallelWriter.TryAdd that takes a thread index argument is internal now
* UnsafeParallelHashMap.ParallelWriter.TryAdd that takes a thread index argument is internal now
* Significant performance improvements, especially when not burst compiled, across the board in all containers
* Implementation for NativeRingQueue simplified and performance increased greatly

### Removed

* GenPerformanceComparisonMd
* InternalsVisibleTo reference to Tiny

### Fixed

* All HashMap and HashSet types are now consistently initialized with a capacity no less than the `minGrowth` specified
* Incorrect markdown syntax for header anchors
* `UnsafeAppendBuffer` now safely reads and writes type `T`. Previously, it was possible to make unaligned reads and writes of type `T` which could violate platform architecture alignment requirements.

## [2.1.0-pre.11] - 2023-02-13

### Added

* Ability to resize `Unsafe/NativeBitArray` with `Resize`, `SetCapacity`, `TrimExcess` methods.
* `.Substring` method to `FixedStringN`, and `NativeText`.
* `NativeRingQueue`.
* `CollectionHelper.Dispose` to dispose a NativeArray without Allocator input parameter.

### Changed

* Reviewed all safety checks and made many of them supported with `UNITY_DOTS_DEBUG` in addition to `ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS`
* Optimize `RewindableAllocator`.
* Underlying algorithm for `*HashMap/Set` containters to improve performance.

### Fixed

* Code generation responsible for early initialization of JobReflectionData could previously emit enormous amounts of code that could dramatically increase IL2CPP build times. We now produce the minimal amount of code necessary and no longer impact IL2CPP compilation times.
* Removed unnecessary test and documentation samples assemblies from always being loaded in projects.
* `NativeHashSet.ToNativeArray(allocator)` now works with custom allocators
* `AllocatorManager.Block.AllocatedBytes` and `AllocatorManager.Block.Bytes` properties could overflow returning incorrect negative values.


## [2.1.0-pre.6] - 2022-11-23

### Fixed
* `FixedListNBytes.Buffer` and `FixedString.GetUnsafePtr()` could return an invalid pointer in some cases, if the target object was `readonly`.

* BinarySearch is using read-only access.
* Memory leak in `Native/UnsafeStream` due to orphaned block.
* Debug visualizers display content even when safety handle is in write-only mode.

* `UnsafeList.ParallelReader` replaced by `UnsafeList.ReadOnly`.
* `NativeList.AsParallelReader()` replaced by `NativeList.AsReadOnly()`.
* Implicit cast operator from `NativeList<T>` to `NativeArray<T>`. Explicit cast method `NativeList<T>.AsArray()` should be used instead.

### Security




## [0.17.0] - 2021-03-15

### Added

* `[NotBurstCompatible]` attribute to FixedStringN constructors that use a String argument.
* `[NotBurstCompatible]` attribute to NativeQueue constructor.
* `UnsafeList<T>.Create` and `UnsafeList<T>.Destroy` API.
* BurstCompatibilityTests now has a constructor that accepts multiple assembly names to verify Burst compatibility. This allows one test to verify multiple assemblies and can dramatically reduce CI times by avoiding costly setup overhead.
* `UnsafePtrList<T>` to replace deprecated untyped `UnsafePtrList`.
* Burst compatibility tests now also write the generated code to the Temp directory in order to make it easier to inspect.
* `FixedList*.RemoveRange*` with index/count arguments.
* FixedString parsing to type uint


### Deprecated

* untyped UnsafePtrList, and added `UnsafePtrList<T>` as replacement.
* `FixedList*.RemoveRange*WithBeginEnd` methods with begin/end arguments in favor of `FixedList*.RemoveRange*` with index/count arguments.

### Removed

* Removed single arg `FixedString*.Format` extension methods, use `Clear()` followed by `Append()`.
* CollectionsBurstTests has been removed and placed into the Entities test project.

### Fixed

* `*BitArray.Clear` when clearing with very short bit arrays.
* `NativeQueue.AsParallelWriter` doesn't need to be cached when chaining jobs. Removed unnecessary safety handle that was preventing calling `NativeQueue.AsParallelWriter()` multiple times when scheduling jobs.


## [0.16.0] - 2021-01-26

### Deprecated

* Sort methods that return a JobHandle deprecated in favor of new SortJob methods that return a job struct. Less conveniently, the user is responsible for calling Schedule on the struct, but this pattern better accommodates scheduling generic jobs from Bursted code (See https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/ecs_generic_jobs.html).

### Removed

* Removed deprecated `FixedListN.IndexOf` and `SortJob` variants

### Fixed

* An ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS define was misspelled. Now Memory is checked for reasonable byte length when enabled.

* Updated `com.unity.burst` to `1.4.4`


## [0.15.0] - 2020-11-13

### Added

* `[BurstCompatible]` attribute to VMRange, Baselib_ErrorState, and VirtualMemoryUtility.
* `[BurstCompatible]` attribute to xxHash3.

### Changed

* Update burst to 1.4.1.

* Update minimum editor version to 2020.1.2f1

### Fixed

* Code generation for indexers in structs with [BurstCompatible] attribute.
* *BitArray search for empty bits when number of bits is less than 7 and backing storage is fragmented with 0x81 bit pattern.
* Namespace for `*HashSet.ExceptWith/IntersectWith/UnionWith` extension methods, so that use of `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe` namespace is not necessary.
* using FixedList.ToNativeArray with collection checks enabled used to throw a null reference exception.

## [0.14.0] - 2020-09-24

### Added

* `*UnsafeBitArray.Find` with pos/count search range arguments.

### Changed

* `UnsafeStream` block allocation performance has been improved by ~16% by appending to the start of the per-thread block lists rather than the end.

### Removed

* `FixedList*.InsertRange`, `FixedList*.RemoveRangeSwapBack`, `FixedList*.RemoveRange`, `NativeString*`, `NativeList.RemoveRangeSwapBack`, `NativeList.RemoveRange`, `UnsafeList.RemoveRangeSwapBack`, `UnsafeList.RemoveRange`, `FixedString*.Format`, `FixedString*.AppendFrom`, `NativeHashSet.TryAdd`, `UnsafeHashSet.TryAdd`.
* `[NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletion]` attribute from `NativeReference` container. It didn't work properly. Users can use `Dispose(JobHandle)` method instead.

### Fixed

* Added `foreach` support to `UnsafeList<T>`.

### Changed

* `Sort` functions that take an `IComparer` no longer require the sorted elements to be `IComparable`
* Bumped Burst to 1.3.5.

### Deprecated

* Deprecated `SortJob` with default job dependency argument. Use `Sort` that require an explicit JobHandle argument. If no dependency is needed, pass a default valued JobHandle.

* Removed: `UnsafeUtilityEx`, `Unity.Collections.Experimental*`,`FixedString*.UTF8LengthInBytes`, and `*Stream.ComputeItemCount()`

### Fixed

* Fixed performance regression of `*HashMap.Count()` introduced in Collections 0.10.0.


## [0.12.0] - 2020-08-04

### Added

 * Added `HeapString` type, for arbitrary-length (up to 2GB) heap-allocated strings
   compatible with the `FixedString*` methods.  Allocating a `HeapString` requires
   specifying an allocator and disposing appropriately.

    `JobUnsafeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue`

### Fixed

 * Fixed `*HashMap.IsEmpty` when items are added and removed from `*HashMap. IsEmpty` previously
   used allocated count only to report emptiness, but returning not-empty didn't actually
   meant that `*HashMap` is not empty.
 * Fixed bug where `*HashSet.Enumerator.Current` would always return the default value instead of the actual value from the set.
 * Fixed bug with `*HashMap/Set.Enumerator` returning wrong index and dereferencing out of bounds memory.


## [0.11.0] - 2020-07-10

### Added

 * Added `VirtualMemoryUtility` providing low-level virtual memory utility functions backed by baselib.
 * `*HashMap` and `*HashSet` now implement `IEnumerable<>`.
 * `ReadArrayElementBoundsChecked` and `WriteArrayElementBoundsChecked` for ease of debugging `ReadArrayElement` and `WriteArrayElement` without sacrificing performance by adding bounds checking directly to those functions.
 * Added `InsertRangeWithBeginEnd`, `RemoveRangeSwapBackWithBeginEnd`, and `RemoveRangeWithBeginEnd` to list containers.
   `*WithBeginEnd` in name signifies that arguments are begin/end instead of more standard index/count. Once
   `InsertRange`, `RemoveRangeSwapBack`, and `RemoveRange` are completely deprecated and removed,
   those methods will be added with correct index/count arguments.
 * Added `xxHash3` type to expose 64/128bits hashing API using xxHash3 algorithm (corresponding to the C++ version https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/v0.8.0)
### Changed

 * Updated minimum Unity Editor version to 2020.1.0b15 (40d9420e7de8)
 * Bumped burst to 1.3.2 version.
 * Changed `*HashSet.Add` API to return bool when adding element to set.
 * `UnsafeUtilityExtensions` is now public.
 * `NativeReference` methods `Equals` and `GetHashCode` will now operate on the value instead of the data pointer.
 * `FixedString{32,64,128,512,4096}` have been reworked.
   * Functionality is shared via generics as much as possible.  The API attempts to follow `StringBuilder` semantics.
   * `Append` methods now consistently append.
   * `Append` variant to append a char was added (appends the `char`, does not resolve to int overload).
   * `Format` methods that replaced the contents of the target have been deprecated.  Use `Clear()` followed by `Append()`.  Because FixedStrings start out cleared, in most cases just an `Append` is sufficient.
   * `Format` that takes a format string has been renamed to `AppendFormat`.  The static `FixedString.Format` methods still exist for convenience, and return a `FixedString128`.
   * It is possible for users to extend the `Append` family of methods to support appending their own types.  See `FixedStringAppendMethods.cs` for examples of how to declare your own extension methods.

### Deprecated

 * Deprecated `*HashSet.TryAdd`. `*HashSet.Add` is equivalent.
 * Deprecated `NativeString*`. The functionality is replaced by `FixedString*`.
 * Deprecated `InsertRange`, `RemoveRangeSwap`, and `RemoveRange` from list containers, and added
   `InsertRangeWithBeginEnd`, `RemoveRangeSwapBackWithBeginEnd`, and `RemoveRangeWithBeginEnd`.
   `*WithBeginEnd` in name signifies that arguments are begin/end instead of more standard index/count. Once
   `InsertRange`, `RemoveRangeSwapBack`, and `RemoveRange` are completely deprecated and removed,
   those methods will be added with correct index/count arguments.

### Removed

 * Removed `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll` from package.


### Known Issues

* This version is not compatible with 2020.2.0a17. Please update to the forthcoming alpha.

All containers allocated with `Allocator.Temp` on the same thread use a shared `AtomicSafetyHandle` instance. This is problematic when using `NativeHashMap`, `NativeMultiHashMap`, `NativeHashSet` and `NativeList` together in situations where their secondary safety handle is used. This means that operations that invalidate an enumerator for either of these collections (or the `NativeArray` returned by `NativeList.AsArray`) will also invalidate all other previously acquired enumerators.
For example, this will throw when safety checks are enabled:
```
var list = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Temp);
list.Add(1);

// This array uses the secondary safety handle of the list, which is
// shared between all Allocator.Temp allocations.
var array = list.AsArray();

var list2 = new NativeHashSet<int>(Allocator.Temp);

// This invalidates the secondary safety handle, which is also used
// by the list above.
list2.TryAdd(1);

// This throws an InvalidOperationException because the shared safety
// handle was invalidated.
var x = array[0];
```
This defect will be addressed in a future release.




## [0.10.0] - 2020-05-27


### Added

 * Added `Native/UnsafeHashSet` containers.
 * Added `IsEmpty` method to `*Queue`, `*HashMap`, `*MultiHashMap`, `*List`, `FixedString`.
   This method should be prefered to `Count() > 0` due to simpler checks for empty container.
 * Added a new container `NativeReference` to hold unmanaged allocation.
 * Added `CollectionsTestFixture` to enable jobs debugger and verify safety checks are enabled.
 * Added `NativeList.CopyFrom(NativeArray<> array)`

### Changed
 * Updated minimum Unity Editor version to 2020.1.0b9 (9c0aec301c8d)
 * Updated package `com.unity.burst` to version `1.3.0-preview.12`.
 * Made several tests inherit `CollectionsTestFixture` to prevent crashing when running tests without jobs debugger or safety checks enabled.
 * Added `NativeBitArray.AsNativeArray<T>` method to reinterpret `NativeBitArray` as
   `NativeArray` of desired type.

### Deprecated

 * Deprecated `NativeArrayChunked8` and `NativeArrayFullSOA` from Unity.Collections.Experimental.
 * Deprecated `UnsafeUtilityEx.As/AsRef/ArrayElementAsRef`. The functionality is available in `UnsafeUtility`.

 * `FixedString` and `FixedList` types now display their contents in the Entity Inspector.
 * Fixed `NativeHashMap.ParallelWriter.TryAdd` race condition.

## [0.9.0] - 2020-05-04

### Added

 * Added `RemoveAt` and `RemoveRange` to List containers in collections. These methods remove
   elements in list container while preserving order of the list. These methods are slower than
   `Remove*SwapBack` methods and users should prefer `Remove*SwapBack` if they don't care about
   preserving order inside \*List container.
 * Added `*BitArray.Copy` between two different bit arrays.
 * Added `NativeBitArrayUnsafeUtility.ConvertExistingDataToNativeBitArray` for assigning view into
   data as bit array.

   `IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue`, `JobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue`, `IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue`,
   `JobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue`, and introduced `NativeHashMap.GetUnsafeBucketData` and
   `NativeMultiHashMap.GetUnsafeBucketData` to obtain internals to implement deprecated functionality
   inside user code. If this functionality is used, the best is to copy deprecated code into user code.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-11-22

**This version requires Unity 2019.3 0b11+**

### New Features

* Added fixed-size UTF-8 NativeString in sizes of 32, 64, 128, 512, and 4096 bytes.

* Added HPC# functions for UTF16-to-UTF8 and UTF8-to-UTF16.
* New `Native(Multi)HashMap.GetKeyValueArrays` that will query keys and values
  at the same time into parallel arrays.
* Added `UnsafeStream`, `UnsafeHashMap`, and `UnsafeMultiHashMap`, providing
  functionality of `NativeStream` container but without any safety mechanism
  (intended for advanced users only).
* Added `AddNoResize` methods to `NativeList`. When it's known ahead of time that
  list won't grow, these methods won't try to resize. Rather exception will be
  thrown if capacity is insufficient.
* Added `ParallelWriter` support for `UnsafeList`.
* Added `UnsafeList.TrimExcess` to set capacity to actual number of elements in
  the container.
* Added convenience blittable `UnsafeList<T>` managed container with unmanaged T
  constraint.

  `UnsafeList.SetCapacity` to lower capacity of the list. This applies to all other
  containers based on `UnsafeList`.
* Updated dependencies for this package.

  instead. The deprecated function will be removed in 3 months. This can not be auto-upgraded
  prior to Unity `2019.3`.
* Fixing bug where `TryDequeue` on an empty `NativeQueue` that previously had enqueued elements could leave it in
  an invalid state where `Enqueue` would fail silently afterwards.

### Changes

* Updated dependencies for this package.
