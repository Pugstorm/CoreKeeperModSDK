# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome feedback both as [Issues](../../issues) and [Pull Requests](../../pulls).

By submitting a pull request, you confirm that you have read and agree to the [EULA](EULA.txt).

Pull requests are not usually merged directly, as the SDK is updated frequently from the main project.

Contributions will be reviewed and integrated where appropriate.
